# Classification-Challenge
Created two classification models to fit the  data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models used will be a logistic regression model and a random forest model.

Results:

Although both model's predictions showed favorable results, the Random Forest Classifier model yielded a higher accuracy of detecting spam at 96.7% compared to the logistic regression model's 93.1%
